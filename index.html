        <p>
    Hi! My name is Taylor. I live in Cleveland, Ohio. I'm 15 years old and going into my junior year at Cleveland School of the Arts. I decided to take this course because I feel like it can bring me out of my shell, while also helping me learn more about technology. My favorite video games are Cry of Fear, Until Dawn, Catherine Full Body, and Roblox. My favorite shows are Moral Orel, Metalocalypse, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. I like watching lots of documentaries about the internet, reading mystery books, watching horror movies, listening to music, and drawing characters from my favorite shows. (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
