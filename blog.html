       <p>My favorite robot character is Mr. Butlertron from Clone High. He is my favorite character because he always gives the other characters advice and he tries to sympathize with humans as much as possible even though he doesn’t always understand. He definitely makes me sympathize with AI and robots more. My emotions remained the same when we got to meet Ray today. I thought she was a little scary at first, but then she talked about how she had to experience life through a robot body and it made me appreciate her a little more.

       <p>Today we had to make an infographic that answers a question. The question that I answered was "What are the most popular genres of music among teenagers and why? The infographic I made is above.</p>

       <h2>Game Jam: Cipher Search</h2>

       <IMG src="Cipher Search Group Photo.jpg">
      <p>Today we had to make a game that related to technology. We were split into random groups, and I worked with Mary and Marrae. The theme of our game was cryptography. The game is called Cipher Search. Here’s how to play:
      </p>
      <p>★Pull a random sheet of paper out of the bucket
      </p>
      <p>★Decode whatever is written on the piece of paper to get a hint about an item’s location.
      </p>
      <p>★Find your item to win points! Some items are better hidden than others and will give you more points!
      </p>
      
      <p>We had some difficulties because some of the coding was wrong/backwards. Instead of the cipher being +6, it was -6. We had to correct the cards accordingly, and if we had more time we could have made some of the puzzles easier.</p>

      <p>Machine Learning Meme

            This meme explains how statistics are a core component of machine learning and organizing data. It uses a Scooby Doo scene of Fred removing the monster's mask to show that machine learning and statistics are similar.

        <h2>Genevieve Grotjan</h2>
        <p>Taylor Germany
         7/18/23</p>

         <p>
         Genevieve Grotjan Fenstein was a cryptanalyst who made history with her discoveries. She was hired to work for the Army Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) in 1939. In 1940, she would make a groundbreaking discovery that would allow the SIS to build an analog machine that decoded the Japanese diplomatic system “Purple”. By understanding Purple, they were given all types of important information about Japan’s plans for war and scheduled attack locations.

         In October of 1943, Ms. Grotjan was assigned to the Soviet problem and worked on the project later known as "Venona." She came up with a process for recognizing the re-use of key, which played a big role in the decryption of Russian KGB messages.

          Also in 1943, Ms. Grotjan married a chemist by the name of Hyman Feinstein. After serving as a cryptanalyst and a research analyst for over seven years, She resigned from the government in 1947 and became a mathematics professor at George Mason University. Genevieve Grotjan Feinstein died in 2006 at the age of 93. Before his death in 1995, Hyman Feinstein received an award in cryptology from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at George Mason in honor of his wife.
